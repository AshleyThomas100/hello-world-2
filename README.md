Mission statement.
I suck. I make the most stupid decisions and I lose everything. I'm even 'losing' my house in an attempt to pay back my debts and live an honest, more relaxed life. 
But, we know that's not going to happen, because I'll see all that money in the bank and I won't do the right thing. I'll drink, smoke, get pros, and lose all the money. That's what I mean - a real loser. A sucker. I finally realise the meaning of that word.
I'm really going to try to get it right this time! But I said that last time too.
I have a loose plan to remaster JDEdwards into a light ERP but I wanna call it FRP, for families. I'm not sure it's legal but it's worth a shot.
There's a lot of unused functionality in JDE, unused table columns, from the point of view a small family business.
With today's modern options such as Javascript, web services, in-memory database and full stack development including Blockchain perhaps.
I want to train to become a Full Stack developer, instead of waiting around for jobs in a declining marketplace. The family needs me to make this change. I need to make this change for me too because waiting around for an IN, is depressing.
FRP needs to be cool. FRP is not a cool name.
I intend to create CRM, Crystal Ball (Accounts), (Buying, Selling and Work) Orders, Manufacturing,  Health, Education modules.
Possible: If the user has private property for rent, the user could make use of a Property Management module.
It is like JDE but on a smaller scale, more lightweight. No bullshit unnecessary modules like e.g. Green House Gases.
Also, it is to be cloud-averse. Family-focussed data has no place in a building in California.
Legislation module. That way local legislation could overwrite the main code.
Multi-language, multi-currency, multi-calendar.
Database: The main difference in the database will be the entire database is held locally in static memory blocks connected via USB-C.
