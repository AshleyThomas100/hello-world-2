I am a loser. I lose everything. I've even lost my house in an attempt to pay back my debts. But, we know that's not going to happen, because I'll see all that money in the bank and I won't do the right thing. I'll drink, smoke, get pros, and lose all the money. That's what I mean - a real loser.
I have a loose plan to copy JDEdwards and create my own ERP but I wanna call it FRP. I'm not sure it's legal but it'll be better than JDEdwards, eventually.
With today's modern options such as Java, Javascript (i'm led to believe) and faster databases, Blockchain perhaps.
I want to train to become a Full Stack developer, instead of waiting around for jobs in a declining marketplace.
If I create an FRP, it should give me lots of options, if it's good.
I intend to create Health and Education modules.
If the user has private property for rent, the user could make use of the Property Management module.
It is like JDE but on a smaller scale, more lightweight. No bullshit unnecessary modules like Green House Gases.
Legislation module. That way local legislation could overwrite the main code.
The main difference in the database will be the entire database is held locally in static memory blocks.
